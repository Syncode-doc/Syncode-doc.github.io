    <h1> The Little Prince </h1>
    <p> As the little prince dropped off to sleep. I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. </p>
    <p> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</p>
    <p> It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. </p>
    <p> In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself
    : "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What us nist unoirtabd is invisible..." </p>
    <p> As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself again: "What moves me so deeply, about 
    this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being 
    like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</p>
    <p> And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished
    by a little puff of wind...</p>
