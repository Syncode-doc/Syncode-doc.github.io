    <div class="text-box">
    
    <p> As the little prince dropped off to sleep. I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
    <span class="underline_blue">I felt deeply moved, and stirred.</span> 
    <span class="underline_blue">It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
    <span class="highlight"> It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
    In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, 
    and I said to myself: <span class="quote">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span>
     As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:<span class="quote"> "What moves me so deeply,
    about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through 
    his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span>
     And I felt him to be more fragile still. <span class="underline_blue">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that 
    might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
